# Lab 3: VHDL Code for Combinational Circuits (Encoder and Decoder)

## Objective

    • To design and simulate a 4-to-2 priority encoder in VHDL. • To design and simulate a 2-to-4 decoder in VHDL.

## Theory

## Encoder
An encoder converts 2n input lines into an n-bit binary code. Only one input is active (HIGH) at a time. A 4-to-2 encoder has 4 inputs (I0–I3) and produces a 2-bit output (Y1Y0). A priority encoder handles the case where multiple inputs are high simultaneously by giving priority to the highest-numbered active input.

I3 I2 I1 I0 Y1 Y0
0 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 1 X 0 1
0 1 X X 1 0
1 X X X 1 1

## Decoder
A decoder converts an n-bit binary input into one of 2n output lines. A 2-to-4 decoder has a 2-bit input (A1A0) and 4 output lines (Y0–Y3). Exactly one output is HIGH at a time.

### A1 A0 Y3 Y2 Y1 Y0
### 0 0 0 0 0 1
### 0 1 0 0 1 0
### 1 0 0 1 0 0
### 1 1 1 0 0 0

## Discussion and colclusion
Therefore from this lab, we verify that a priority encoder handles the case where multiple inputs are high simultaneously by giving priority to the highest-numbered active input and a decoder converts an n-bit binary input into one of 2^n output lines.
